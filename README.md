## Getting Started

Java code for reading and processing unary automata written in the form of a string. Provides the operations of Square, Concatenation and Star, as well as NFA to DFA conversion using the Subset Construction Algorithm, and DFA minimization using Hopcroft's algorithm.

## Folder Structure

Notable folders:

- `src`: contains the code
- `UnaryAutomataList`: full list of unary automata of all combinations from state size 2 to 16 in string form
